# Hexcrawling

Hexcrawling is simplified Twine version of *Hexcrawling Alone in the Wilderness by [Azukail Games](https://azukailgames.itch.io/hexcrawling-alone-in-the-wilderness).

The game can be accesss [here](https://teranya.github.io/hexcrawling/)

This version removes the need for a dice and cards by randomizing the events for you, it still requires you to use your own writing/drawing software + utensils.


You are an explorer, randomly travelling through the wilderness regions at the borders of civilisation. You travel to new hexes, making a note of what you find in each place, both terrain features and encounters. You find many things in your travels, and experience dangers as well. Some places you venture to have features worthy of further, more detailed exploration. Whether or not you choose to explore these features is up to you.
